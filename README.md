# SearchEngine_IR
## INTRODUCTION

This is our Search Engine Project. It includes the following process:

Reading files from a given corpus, segmenting them into documents.

Parsing the corpus in batches of 50000 documents, one by one. 

The parsing could be executed with or without stemming.

Indexing the terms of each batch: 

creating posting files and writing information about the terms into them. 

In addition, we create a file containing information about all the parsed documents and a united dictionary for the entire corpus.
